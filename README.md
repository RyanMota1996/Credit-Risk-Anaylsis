# Credit-Risk-Analysis

## Anaylsis Overview
The purpose of this anaylsis is to find which algorithm would be bsest for calcuatiing credit card risk.

## Results 
From our six machines the results are as follow
- Navie Random Oversampling

      Balanced Accuracy score of 0.6463970560994359

      Precison score of 0.99

      Recall score of 0.58

- SMOTE oversampling

      Balanced Accuracy score of 0.662394124702461

      Precison score of 0.99

      Recall of score 0.58
  
- Cluster Centroid 

      Balanced Accuracy score of 0.6463970560994359

      Precison of score 0.99

      Recall of 0.42
  
- SMOTEENN over and under sampling

      Balanced accuracy score of 0.6463970560994359

      precison score of 0.99

      recall score of 0.57


- BalancedRandomForestClassifier 

      Balanced accuracy score of 0.7595452745695523

      precison score of 0.99

      Recall score of 0.87

- EasyEnsembleClassifier

      Balanced accuracy score of 0.9323031958247274

      Precison score of 0.99

      Recall score of 0.94


## Summary and Conclusion
From our six machines while precison scores are more or less consistant. However we see a varitey of scores for accuracy. accuracy as well varied widely from all the machines used. Taking this all into consideration i would recommenmd the EasyEnsenbleClassifier algorithm. It is far above the others in terms of balanced accuracy score and recall score. This suggests that this machine is the best bet in terms of modeling and would give the most consistant and most reliable information.
